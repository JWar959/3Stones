2025-09-14

- Edited `board.cpp` to fix comparisons in `hasEmptyInRow` and `hasEmptyInCol` so that they compare `Pocket.s` against `Stone::Empty` instead of comparing `Pocket` to `Stone`. (20 minutes)

- Updated `types.hpp` to clean up stone conversion helpers:
  - Removed duplicate overloads of `stoneToChar`.
  - Kept a `char stoneToChar(Stone)` and added `std::string stoneToString(Stone)` wrapper. (15 minutes)

- Enhanced `Round::applyMove` in `round.cpp` to build a clear `lastExplanation_` string that reports the stone placed, its coordinates, and points scored for both players. (25 minutes)

- Modified `main.cpp` game loop:
  - Added retry logic so human players are explicitly re-prompted on illegal moves.
  - Suppressed ‚ÄúIllegal move‚Äù spam for the computer by retrying silently.
  - Added a maximum retry safeguard to avoid infinite loops. (40 minutes)

- Fixed misplaced closing brace in `main.cpp` so round wrap-up and tournament messages appear *after* the loop. (10 minutes)

**Total time today:** ~1 hour 50 minutes

- Resolved multiple compile errors (curly bracket mismatch, missing includes, wrong type signatures).
- Fixed `stoneToChar` overload issues and vector-related errors in Computer class.
- Corrected help callback wiring (`helpCb` ‚Üí `help`).
- Adjusted serialization load to restore `lastOppCoord` and next player correctly.
- Verified color consistency in help mode (suggestions match human‚Äôs actual color).

**Testing (1.0h)**  
- Ran full round to confirm:
  - Computer move rationales print.
  - Help suggestions appear with correct color.
  - Illegal move spam suppressed.
  - Serialization works: save to `save.txt` and resume properly.
- Verified scoring triples in rows and diagonals award points correctly.

**Total: 4.0h**

Sep 20, 2025

Implemented robust file parsing in serializer.cpp: added trim and starts_with_label, tolerated extra spaces, and matched the professor‚Äôs sample format for ‚ÄúHuman Player‚Äù, ‚ÄúComputer Player‚Äù, ‚ÄúNext Player‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBoard:‚Äù lines 
(1.5 hours).

Fixed strlen compile error by including <cstring> and switched equality check to use label-length comparison in starts_with_label 
(20 mins).

Reworked inventory loading path: added Player::setInventory(const Inventory&) and used it during load to set myColor, counts, points, and roundsWon atomically; removed illegal brace-initializer assignment 
(45 mins).

Verified loading of professor‚Äôs gen.txt and other samples; identified mismatch in our save format vs. load format and standardized both directions (save now mirrors load, including spacing and row tokenization) 
(1 hour).

Persisted and restored turn state: wrote/parsed ‚ÄúNext Player: ‚Ä¶ r c‚Äù so round.initFromLoad(nextIsHuman, lastOpp) restores whose turn it is and the last move coordinate; fixed duplicate stub definition vs. implementation 
(30 mins).

Main loop UX: on resume, printed ‚ÄúNext to move‚Äù and ‚ÄúLast move ‚Ä¶ at (r,c)‚Äù with reminder of the row/column restriction; added reminder line before each turn if a last move exists 
(45 mins).

Enforced legality on resume: confirmed ‚Äúmust play in same row/col (unless both full)‚Äù by checking anyAvailableOnRowOrCol() and rejecting moves off-line; reproduced and fixed a case where off-line move was incorrectly accepted after load 
(1 hour).

Help system stability: reconnected Human help callback naming (help_), ensured ‚ÄòH‚Äô re-prompts instead of consuming a stone, and displayed the computer‚Äôs suggestion with rationale when available 
(30 mins).

Messaging polish: prefixed move explanations with actor (‚ÄúHuman‚Äù/‚ÄúComputer‚Äù), used stoneToString() consistently in messages, and confirmed score deltas print after each legal move 
(30 mins).

Name prompt: added Human::inputName() and integrated a friendly welcome banner; wired the name into the ‚ÄúNext to move‚Äù/‚ÄúLast move‚Äù display for clarity 
(30 mins).

Total hours today: 7 hours, 10 minutes

## Student: John Warren
### Course: CMPS 366 ‚Äî 3 Stones
### Session Times (EST): 9:10‚Äì12:35, 1:15‚Äì4:45 (‚âà6h 55m total)

### Goals for Today

Add ‚ÄúPlay another round?‚Äù tournament loop per spec.

Make Resume robust: load our save.txt and instructor samples (gen.txt, winning.txt).

Ensure resume shows who moves next and the last move (so row/col legality is clear).

Keep Help (H) correct for the human‚Äôs actual color; show rationale.

Minor polish: optional human name input at startup; avoid duplicate prompts.

### Work Completed
- A) Tournament replay loop

What: After each round, prompt ‚ÄúPlay another round? (Y/N)‚Äù and either start a new Round or end and print tournament winner by rounds won (not points).

Where: main.cpp

Approach (pseudocode):

do {
    setup or resume round
    play round loop
    announce round winner; tally roundsWon
} while (user says Y)
announce tournament winner (by roundsWon)

Why: Matches ‚ÄúThe Tournament‚Äù section of the assignment.

- B) Resume: loader compatibility & UX

What: Load both our own save.txt and instructor samples (gen.txt, winning.txt) reliably.

Where: serializer.cpp, main.cpp

Key changes:

starts_with_label() + trim() to tolerate spacing after labels.

Board parsing maps tokens to valid pockets per row using the board‚Äôs mask (handles tapered octagon + center void).

Next Player: parsing sets nextIsHuman and adjusts lastOpp 1-based‚Üí0-based; supports ‚Äúno last move‚Äù with -1 -1.

In main.cpp, after successful load:

Print Next to move and Last move (with 1-based coords and stone).

Print row/col legality reminder.

Removed a duplicate resume block that caused the same file prompt twice.

- C) Help mode correctness

What: Ensure H suggestions honor human‚Äôs color and show rationale.

Where: human.cpp, main.cpp

Key changes:

human.setHelpCallback([&cpu](...) { return cpu.recommendForHuman(...); });

readStoneFromInv(...) re-prompts after H (non-consuming), prints rationale when available.

Verified hints as White and Black.

- D) Human name (optional)

What: Added friendly name prompt without breaking serialization paths.

Where: human.hpp/.cpp, main.cpp

Key changes:

Human::inputName() (safe getline w/ leading newline drain).

Human::setHumanName()/getHumanName() (non-breaking; display uses Player::name() for now).

Guarded so Resume flow still works regardless of input name.

- Files Touched (today)

src/main.cpp ‚Äî tournament loop; single, non-duplicated resume flow; last-move banner; save-and-quit; name prompt.

src/serializer.cpp ‚Äî tolerant label parsing; valid-pocket mapping; Next Player + lastOpp handling; save/write alignment.

src/human.hpp / src/human.cpp ‚Äî help callback wiring; color-correct help; inputName, setHumanName, getHumanName.

- Tests Conducted

New -> move-> Save -> Resume (our save.txt)

Observed correct Next to move and Last move banner.

Row/col legality reminder printed.

Computer takes turn first when nextIsHuman == false.

Load instructor samples

gen.txt, winning.txt imported; board shape and stones placed match file.

Legality banner computed from lastOpp. 

Help mode

As White and Black, H suggests a stone color matching the human‚Äôs inventory/color and prints rationale.

Tournament flow

After round end, prompt ‚ÄúPlay another round? (Y/N)‚Äù.

On Y, new round plays; on N, prints tournament winner by roundsWon.

Issues & Resolutions (today)

Duplicate resume prompts
Symptom: Asked for the filename twice.
Fix: Consolidated to a single resume branch in main.cpp; removed stale prompt block.

Instructor files not loading fully
Symptom: Board half-parsed, then ‚ÄúLoad failed; starting new game.‚Äù
Fix: Use board‚Äôs valid pocket mask per row to map tokens; tolerant starts_with_label(); robust Next Player/lastOpp handling.

Help hints wrong color (earlier regression)
Fix: Pass human‚Äôs color into recommender; re-prompt after H.

Name prompt interfering with resume
Fix: Read name via getline before mode prompt, draining leading newlines; no impact on loader.

Conformance Notes (rubric alignment snapshot)

Serialization: Save/load works with both our save.txt and the instructor‚Äôs formats; last move and next player restored.

Help Mode: Displays a concrete recommended play (stone + pocket) and rationale; respects human‚Äôs color/inventory.

Computer Play: Computer only plays stones from its own inventory; prints brief rationale.

Legality: Enforced row/col rule relative to last opponent move; exception when both row & column are full.

Tournament: Replays rounds; winner by rounds won; final announcement on exit.

OOP: Virtual chooseMove, distinct Human/Computer classes, Round orchestrates flow, Serializer isolated, no globals.

Next Steps (for final polishing)

Docs refresh: Manual screenshots (New, Help, Save/Resume, Instructor sample), and today‚Äôs log entry.

Comments: Ensure each function header has Purpose/Params/Returns; keep pseudocode bullets for complex functions.

Constants: If any 11/center (5,5) remain in multiple spots, centralize (optional polish).

View separation: Keep model classes print-free where practical (we‚Äôre already close).

Status: Feature-complete for demo and rubric; ready for presentation rehearsal.

### Time Spent

Implementation & fixes: ~5h

Testing & verification: ~1h 55m

# Project Log ‚Äî 3 Stones (CMPS366)

## Student: John Warren
## Date: 2025-09-21
## Round: Milestone 2 ‚Üí late debugging & polish
Total time in session: 2h 15m (see per-task times below). 

- Goals for this session

Fix a scoring edge case where blocking with the opponent‚Äôs color sometimes ‚Äúgifted‚Äù them a point.

Add targeted scoring traces that fire only on real moves that change the score.

Produce reproducible serialization files to recreate the discovered scenario.

Keep changes aligned with code readability and documentation guidelines. 

cpp-writing-guidelines

### Work completed (what & why)

- Scoring rule fix (Board::scoreFromPlacement) ‚Äî 45m

Implemented the ‚Äúno gift on pure opponent triple‚Äù rule: the opponent only scores on this turn if the triple that includes the newly placed stone has at least one Clear and is otherwise opponent-color-or-clear; triples of all opponent color (no clears) score 0 on the blocker‚Äôs turn.

This matches the project rubric: award points for row/col/diag triples, allow up to 2 clears, no points for 3 clears; our change tightens when the opponent can co-score on your turn. 

cppRubric - Copy

Rationale is also consistent with the narrative examples in the rules. 

3stones-rules

- Window validation & hygiene ‚Äî 10m

Confirmed each scored 3-window includes the newly placed cell and contains no Empty pockets, to avoid ‚Äúphantom‚Äù points during evaluation. (Keeps to the rubric‚Äôs ‚Äúpoints only for new arrangements resulting from a play‚Äù.) 

cppRubric - Copy

- Debug printing‚Äîminimal and actionable ‚Äî 30m

Added Board::getScoreEventsIncluding(...) and a one-shot summary in Round::applyMove that prints only when (myAdd || oppAdd); it names the line type (row/column/diag ‚Üò/‚Üó) and the three coordinates that formed the triple.

Also kept debugPrintScoringWindows(...) available but gated so it doesn‚Äôt spam during Computer/Help simulations (AI search), complying with ‚Äúuser-friendly output‚Äù expectations. 

cpp-writing-guidelines

- Reproduction files (serialization) ‚Äî 20m

Created two text saves that match the course format (Human/Computer lines ‚Üí Next Player ‚Üí indented octagon Board; center void on row 6):

repro_before_comp_move.txt ‚Äî right after John plays B at (3,3); Next Player = Computer; scores 0‚Äì0.

repro_after_comp_scored.txt ‚Äî right after Computer plays B at (3,7); scores 0‚Äì1; Next Player = Human.

This follows the required text serialization format and is useful during the demo (prof explicitly tests with serialization). 

3stones-rules

3stones-submission-policy

- Investigation outcome (‚Äúfacepalm‚Äù moment) ‚Äî 10m

Our trace showed the Computer‚Äôs B at (3,7) legitimately completed a descending diagonal (1,5)-(2,6)-(3,7) = BBB, awarding +1 to Computer. This aligns with the rubric‚Äôs scoring for diagonals. 

cppRubric - Copy

- Documentation & style alignment ‚Äî 10m

Ensured changes preserve readability and encapsulation (helpers remain internal; no globals; clear names; comments describe semantics, not syntax). 

cpp-writing-guidelines

Files & functions touched

src/board.cpp

scoreFromPlacement(...): add containsClear gate for opponent scoring; enforce no-Empty; maintain ‚Äúinclude pos‚Äù windowing.

getScoreEventsIncluding(...): gather scoring windows (row/col/diag) including the last placement.

src/round.cpp

Round::applyMove(...): after computing (myAdd, oppAdd), print a one-line score summary (dir + three coords) only if points changed.

Tests / repro

Loaded before file, let AI move; observed summary:
Scored +1 (diag ‚Üò at (1,5)-(2,6)-(3,7)) ‚Üí matches board and rubric rules. 

cppRubric - Copy

Verified no ‚Äúgift‚Äù points when a player completes a pure opponent-color triple by playing the opponent‚Äôs color (no clears involved) ‚Üí 0 points awarded that turn (block only). But if a Clear is part of the triple, co-scoring can occur in the same turn‚Äîper rules. 

cppRubric - Copy

Open items / next steps

 Tomorrow: wire the concise scoring summary (already drafted) if not committed yet.

 Add a few saved scenarios showcasing: (a) co-scoring via Clear, (b) multi-point single move (stone part of multiple lines). 

cppRubric - Copy

 Screenshot requirements for the manual (help list with rationale; computer move explanation).

Generative AI assistance (disclosure)

Areas: Debugging design (scoring logic), instrumentation design (event collector & gated logs), serialization formatting, and authoring this log entry. 

3stones-submission-policy

Representative prompts:

‚ÄúFix scoring when human plays opponent color"

‚ÄúAdd trace that prints only when real moves score; identify row/col/diag and coordinates.‚Äù

‚ÄúBuild reproduction serialization matching indented octagon layout and center void.‚Äù

Nature of help: Design & debugging notes (no wholesale code drops); all code was understood, reviewed, and integrated by the student. (Per policy, assistance is documented and the student can explain the changes.)
