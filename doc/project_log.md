# Project Log ‚Äì 3 Stones (C++)

- **Progress so far**
  - Reviewed project instructions and rubric.  
    - Files: doc/manual.md, doc/project_log.md, cppRubric.docx  
    - Time: 30m  
    - Notes: Clarified submission requirements and grading expectations.  

  - Created initial folder structure and C++ skeleton stubs.  
    - Files: src/main.cpp, board.hpp/.cpp, player.hpp, human.hpp/.cpp, computer.hpp/.cpp, round.hpp/.cpp, tournament.hpp/.cpp, serializer.hpp/.cpp, types.hpp, move.hpp, board_view.*  
    - Time: 1h 30m  
    - Notes: Established baseline classes, headers, and wiring for the game loop.  

  - Implemented basic Board shape and ASCII printing.  
    - Files: board.hpp/.cpp, board_view.*  
    - Time: 1h  
    - Notes: Octagon 11√ó11 with center void, row/col numbering.  

  - Added Human player input (row, col, stone).  
    - Files: human.hpp/.cpp  
    - Time: 45m  
    - Notes: Prompt for input; includes basic inventory check.  

  - Added Computer random move generator.  
    - Files: computer.hpp/.cpp  
    - Time: 40m  
    - Notes: Selects random legal move; strategies to come in Milestone 2.  

  - Implemented Round logic (turn alternation, legality, applyMove).  
    - Files: round.hpp/.cpp  
    - Time: 1h  
    - Notes: Enforced row/col rule with fallback. Added simple move explanation.  

  - Implemented Tournament tracking (round outcome, winner).  
    - Files: tournament.hpp/.cpp  
    - Time: 20m  
    - Notes: Records rounds won and determines winner.  

  - Added Serializer save stub.  
    - Files: serializer.hpp/.cpp  
    - Time: 30m  
    - Notes: Basic text save implemented; load deferred to Milestone 2.  

  - Verified compilation and run inside VS Code terminal.  
    - Files: all (build process)  
    - Time: 20m  
    - Notes: Game loop runs successfully; human/computer turns alternate.  

  - Configured VS Code build and debug (tasks.json and launch.json).  
    - Files: .vscode/tasks.json, .vscode/launch.json  
    - Time: 30m  
    - Notes: Play button now builds all sources with g++ and runs `three_stones`.  

**Total time:** 6h 5m

- Edited `board.cpp` to fix comparisons in `hasEmptyInRow` and `hasEmptyInCol` so that they compare `Pocket.s` against `Stone::Empty` instead of comparing `Pocket` to `Stone`. (20 minutes)

- Updated `types.hpp` to clean up stone conversion helpers:
  - Removed duplicate overloads of `stoneToChar`.
  - Kept a `char stoneToChar(Stone)` and added `std::string stoneToString(Stone)` wrapper. (15 minutes)

- Enhanced `Round::applyMove` in `round.cpp` to build a clear `lastExplanation_` string that reports the stone placed, its coordinates, and points scored for both players. (25 minutes)

- Modified `main.cpp` game loop:
  - Added retry logic so human players are explicitly re-prompted on illegal moves.
  - Suppressed ‚ÄúIllegal move‚Äù spam for the computer by retrying silently.
  - Added a maximum retry safeguard to avoid infinite loops. (40 minutes)

- Fixed misplaced closing brace in `main.cpp` so round wrap-up and tournament messages appear *after* the loop. (10 minutes)

**Total time today:** ~1 hour 50 minutes

Milestone 2

## 2025-09-16
**Design (0.5h)**  
- Reviewed Milestone 2 requirements from instructions and rubric.
- Planned strategy improvements for Computer: self-3, block-3.

**Coding (1.5h)**  
- Implemented `Computer::recommendForHuman` and move rationale strings.
- Updated `Human` to support help key (`H`) and print best suggestion.
- Extended `Round::applyMove` to record rationale.
- Fixed Player constructor usage in Human/Computer to align with `PlayerKind`.
- Integrated serialization prompt after each move.

**Debugging (1.0h)**  
- Resolved multiple compile errors (curly bracket mismatch, missing includes, wrong type signatures).
- Fixed `stoneToChar` overload issues and vector-related errors in Computer class.
- Corrected help callback wiring (`helpCb` ‚Üí `help`).
- Adjusted serialization load to restore `lastOppCoord` and next player correctly.
- Verified color consistency in help mode (suggestions match human‚Äôs actual color).

**Testing (1.0h)**  
- Ran full round to confirm:
  - Computer move rationales print.
  - Help suggestions appear with correct color.
  - Illegal move spam suppressed.
  - Serialization works: save to `save.txt` and resume properly.
- Verified scoring triples in rows and diagonals award points correctly.

**Total: 4.0h**

## Summary
Milestone 2 is complete.  
- Computer implements at least two strategies (completing own 3-in-a-row, blocking opponent).  
- Computer provides rationale for each move.  
- Human help mode suggests legal plays and best strategy.  
- Full serialization/resume is operational.  
- Documentation (manual, log, rubric) updated.
